# Predicting Wine Quality with Several Classification Techniques

![Wine Quality Prediction](https://i.imgur.com/8Zm1B0l.png)

## Project Description
This project develops a machine learning model to predict wine quality using physicochemical properties. The analysis compares four classification algorithms to identify the most effective approach for distinguishing high-quality wines (quality > 6) from standard wines. The solution provides actionable insights for winemakers to optimize production processes.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
  - [Red Wine Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv)
  - [White Wine Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv)
- **Features**: 11 physicochemical properties (e.g., alcohol content, acidity, pH)
- **Target**: Wine quality score, converted to binary classification (quality > 6 = "good")

## Installation
